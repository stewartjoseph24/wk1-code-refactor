# wk1-code-refactor
Week 1 code optimization

## Description
The intent of this project was to evaluate the current, working code, and then improve it. I did so by including specific semantic elements and consolidating CSS rulesets. I defined header, footer, and differing header hierarchies in order to make the website more accessible for everyone. I added comments describing intent and changes made, which should further increase accessibility.

I learned that a good-looking and functional website does not have to be complicated. This set of code was relatively simple to follow, but the finished product is clean and pleasing to the eye. I'm sure improvements can still be made, but I believe this website to be adequate for the intentions of the company.
